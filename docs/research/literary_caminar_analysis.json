  "researchConclusions": [
    "All three literary walking verbs operate on different scales of space, time, and meaning, offering distinct narrative opportunities.",
    "Deambular is ideal for contemporary urban narratives exploring alienation and identity in modern Latin American cities.",
    "Vagar suits expansive narratives of displacement, exile, and search for belonging across geographical and temporal spans.",
    "Errar demands elevated literary style but offers unique opportunity for allegory, classical resonance, and moral-philosophical exploration.",
    "The verbs can be combined within single narrative to show progression: deambular (immediate crisis) → vagar (extended searching) → errar (mythological/eternal significance).",
    "Cultural context matters: Latin American literary tradition (especially magical realism and exile literature) provides rich resonance for all three terms.",
    "Each verb naturally suggests different narrative structures, prose styles, and thematic emphases.",
    "Contemporary authors should consider reader expectations: deambular reads as naturally literary, vagar as traditional/classical, errar as deliberately archaic/elevated."
