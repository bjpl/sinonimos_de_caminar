# Deployment Fix Instructions

## Current Issue

GitHub Pages was rendering README.md with Jekyll instead of serving the actual app. We've disabled Jekyll with `.nojekyll`, but now need to reconfigure the folder setting.

---

## âœ… Solution - Reconfigure GitHub Pages

### Go Back to Settings

**URL**: https://github.com/bjpl/sinonimos_de_caminar/settings/pages

### Current Configuration Check

You should see:
- Source: "Deploy from a branch"
- Branch: **main**
- Folder: This should be **/src**

### If Folder Shows "/" (Root):

**Change it to /src:**
1. Click the folder dropdown
2. Select **/src**
3. Click **Save**
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for rebuild

### If Folder Already Shows "/src":

**Re-save the setting:**
1. Change to "/" (root)
2. Click Save
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. Change back to **/src**
5. Click Save
6. Wait 1-2 minutes

## ðŸ”„ Alternative: Quick Fix (Root Index Redirect)

If the above doesn't work immediately, we can add a redirect in the root:

**I can create this for you if needed** - just let me know!

This creates an index.html in the root that automatically loads the app from /src.

---

## âœ“ When It's Fixed, You'll See:

**At**: https://bjpl.github.io/sinonimos_de_caminar/

- Hero section with walking path image
- Title: "SinÃ³nimos de Caminar"
- 14 cards with images
- Search and filter controls
- NOT the README.md text

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Verification

Once you've re-saved the /src folder setting, wait 1-2 minutes then visit:

```
https://bjpl.github.io/sinonimos_de_caminar/
```

You should see the actual app, not a GitHub-styled README page.

Let me know when you've re-saved the setting and I'll verify it's working!
